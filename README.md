# HR-Data-Analysis
This PowerBI project focuses on evaluating employee attendance and work preferences. The dataset was sourced from an Excel workbook and subsequently refined using Power Query to ensure usability. Noteworthy functionalities encompass DAX Measures for calculating total workdays, days of presence, presence percentage, work-from-home (WFH) days, sick leave, and other relevant metrics.
